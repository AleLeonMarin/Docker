# Docker Documentation

## Introduction

In this documentation based on the video of the YouTuber "Hola Mundo" and some of the same investigation I have done,
I create this documentation with some of the basic concepts that we need to use Docker, and some other concepts that
feel important to understand for the correct use of Docker. Hope it helps you to understand Docker.
